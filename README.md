# flourish-scrolly
Library to allow Flourish scrollytelling in any web page without coding

To use:
* Embed one or more Flourish story in your page
* Give each one a specific height, e.g. `data-height="80vh"`
* To trigger a slide change, just add a hyperlink in the form `#story/story_id/slide-1` (story_id is visible in the embed code; slide-1 is the first slide)
