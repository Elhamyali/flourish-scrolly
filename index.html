			<h1>The Brexit referendum - Statistics & Facts</h1>
			<h2>
				The build-up to Brexit
			</h2>
			<p>
				At 11pm on January 31, 2020 the United Kingdom officially left the European Union, 
				ending a partnership that stretched back almost fifty years. Between the Brexit vote 
				in 2016 and the eventual departure date, the UK witnessed three different Prime Ministers 
				and two general elections, highlighting the political turmoil of those three and a half years. 
				For the rest of 2020, the UK entered into a transition period whereby little changed in terms 
				of travel restrictions or access to the single market. Arguably the real starting date of 
				Brexit is January 1, 2021, as this is when the new EU-UK free trade agreement came into force, 
				nd virtually reset trade and travel relations between the two parties.
			</p>
			<p>
				The UK first joined the European Economic Community (the forerunner organization to the EU) 
				in 1973, after spending years on the sidelines of European integration. Due to political 
				divisions about membership however, a referendum was held two years later in 1975, which 
				was ultimately won by those campaigning to stay in the European community. Opposition to
				membership continued nonetheless, and expressed itself most obviously in the creation of 
				the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). In the 2014 European Elections, UKIP won the 
				highest share of the vote, and probably forced the hand of the Conservative Prime Minister, 
				David Cameron, to promise a referendum on Britain's EU membership should he win re-election 
				in 2015. After winning a decisive majority in the 2015 General Election Cameron set out to 
				renegotiate more favorable terms of with the EU, and then to hold a referendum on membership in 2016.

			<p>				
				Overall, 51.9 percent of people voted to leave the European Union, <a href="#story/92334/slide-1">compared 
				with 48.1 percent of people who opted to remain</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of the 33.57 million people who voted in the referendum, <a href="#story/92334/slide-2">17.4 million voted to leave and 16.1 million 
				voted to remain</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This represented quite a high turnout of 72.2 percent, <a href="#story/92334/slide-3">the highest voter turnout in a UK-wide 
				election</a> since the 1992 General Election.</p>
			<p>
				As the UK approaches the eight anniversary of the Brexit vote in 2024, <a href="#story/92334/slide-4">the vote to leave the EU 
				is gradually becoming less popular</a>. A growing majority of British voters have consistently 
				said they think it was the wrong decision since July 2022. 
			</p>
			<p>
				After securing what he believed to be significant concessions from the EU, 
				Cameron campaigned to remain in the organization, although the issue split 
				his government down the middle, and key allies such as Boris Johnson notably 
				joined the leave side.

				It was a Saturday night in
				December. Much was I disappointed upon <a href="#story/92346/slide-1">learning that</a> the little packet for
				Nantucket had already sailed.
			</p>
			<p>
				With anxious grapnels I had sounded
				my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,&mdash;So, wherever
				you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as <a href="#story/92346/slide-2">I stood
				in the middle of a dreary</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, <a href="#story/92346/slide-3">pausing</a>
				one moment to watch the
				broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses
				within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don&rsquo;t you hear?
			</p>
			<p>
				The first thing I did was to <a href="#story/92346/slide-4">stumble
				over an ash-box in the</a>
				porch.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the weeks leading up to the referendum, opinion polls indicated that 
				the vote would be close, whoever should emerge victorious. While the remain 
				camp focused on the economic impact of Brexit, leave campaigners highlighted 
				the cost of EU membership, claiming that 350 million pounds a week in recuperated 
				costs could be spent on the NHS, with this claim famously written 
				on the side of giant red bus.
			</p>
			<p>
				One week before the vote, UKIP-leader Nigel 
				Farage faced widespread criticism when he unveiled an anti-immigration 
				poster which featured a picture of refugees and the words breaking point on it.
			 </p>
			<p>
				On the same day, the Labour MP Jo Cox was assassinated on the streets of 
				her constituency by a far-right extremist, putting a temporary halt to the 
				campaigning just one week before the referendum.
			</p>
			<p>
				On June 23, 2016, the referendum went ahead as planned and attracted 
				a huge voter turnout. As the results came in overnight, it became clear 
				that leave had won a shock victory gaining 51.9 percent of the votes. 
				Throughout England and Wales the leave vote was victorious, with London 
				being the only region where there were more remain voters. In Scotland 
				and Northern Ireland, the reverse was true, giving fresh impetus to the 
				question of Scottish Independence. A majority of 18 to 24-year-old's had 
				also voted to remain in the European Union, with older voters more likely 
				to have voted to leave. Following the victory of the leave campaign, Brexit 
				was now a reality, but how it would be executed was yet to be decided.
