				CHAPTER 1. Loomings.
			</h2>
			<p>
				Call me Ishmael. Some years ago&mdash;never mind how long precisely&mdash;having
				little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
				shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
				the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the
				circulation.
			</p>
			<p>
				There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves
				as Indian isles by coral reefs&mdash;commerce surrounds it with her surf.
				Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is
				the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by
				breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the
				crowds of water-gazers there.

				Go from Corlears
				Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do
				you see?&mdash;Posted like <a href="#story/92334/slide-1">silent sentinels all around the town</a>, stand
				thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries.
			</p>
			<p>
				Strange! Nothing will content them but the
				extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder
				warehouses will not suffice. No. <a href="#story/92334/slide-2">They
				must get just as nigh the water as</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take
				almost any path you please, and <a href="#story/92334/slide-3">ten to
				one it carries you down in a dale,</a>
				and leaves you there by a pool in the stream.</p>
			<p>
				Should you ever be
				athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan
				happen to be supplied with a <a href="#story/92334/slide-4">metaphysical professor</a>. Yes, as every one
				knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.
			</p>
			<p>
				By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great
				flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that
				swayed me to my purpose.

			<p>
				It was a Saturday night in
				December. Much was I disappointed upon <a href="#story/92346/slide-1">learning that</a> the little packet for
				Nantucket had already sailed.
			</p>
			<p>
				With anxious grapnels I had sounded
				my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,&mdash;So, wherever
				you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as <a href="#story/92346/slide-2">I stood
				in the middle of a dreary</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, <a href="#story/92346/slide-3">pausing</a>
				one moment to watch the
				broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses
				within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don&rsquo;t you hear?
			</p>
			<p>
				The first thing I did was to <a href="#story/92346/slide-4">stumble
				over an ash-box in the</a>
				porch.
			</p>
			<p>
				It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black
				faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of
				Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the
				preacher&rsquo;s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and
				wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out,
				Wretched entertainment at the sign of &lsquo;The Trap!&rsquo;
			</p>
			<p>
				Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks,
				and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging
				sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a
				tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath&mdash;&ldquo;The
				Spouter Inn:&mdash;Peter Coffin.&rdquo;
			 </p>
			<p>
				Coffin?&mdash;Spouter?&mdash;Rather ominous in that particular connexion,
				thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose
				this Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and
				the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little
				wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the
				ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a
				poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very
				spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was a queer sort of place&mdash;a gable-ended old house, one side
				palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak
				corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling
				than ever it did about poor Paul&rsquo;s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,
				is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob
				quietly toasting for bed. &ldquo;In judging of that tempestuous wind called
				Euroclydon,&rdquo; says an old writer&mdash;of whose works I possess the only
				copy extant&mdash;&ldquo;it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest
				out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or
				whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on
				both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.&rdquo; True
				enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind&mdash;old
				black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this
				body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn&rsquo;t stop up the chinks and
				the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But it&rsquo;s
				too late to make any improvements now. The universe is finished; the
				copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago. Poor
				Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow,
				and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug up both
				ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not
				keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his
				red silken wrapper&mdash;(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What
				a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them
				talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give
				me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.
